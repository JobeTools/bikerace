ranked system

give average times based on other routes done if not just average ability of the playerbase, show distance and inclines (low, moderate and high)

after finishing give stats (top speed, avr speed, distance, time, best time on this route, (if ranked - runner/biker level, rating?, ))

- casual
         - app planned route 
              - scenic, no roads, etc settings
         -  no route just distance and time 
              - allow them to create and share their own routes
         - allow racing against their past self possibly when redoing a track

- ranked (5 divisions?)
        - app planned route only
        - 1v1 mode
            - opponents based on division
            - route based on both players pick (take into account incline, rank/rating, distance)
            - if there aren’t enough players use ai (don’t tell them thou hehe lose rating if loss gain if win)
            - if offline probs not gonna work idk think of ideas
